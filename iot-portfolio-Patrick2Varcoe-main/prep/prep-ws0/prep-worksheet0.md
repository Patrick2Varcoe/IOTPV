# UFCFVK-15-2 Internet of Things 

## Preparatory Worksheet 0 - Set up
 
**Topic**: Workspace set up & C++ basics

**Objective**: Configure your workspace to prepare you to run the following worksheets and to refresh or introduce the basics of C++.

### Overview

IoT development implies building systems that integrates different components such as: sensing and actuating devices, data processing and analytics, web and mobile interfaces, among others. Unlike other type of systems, key requirements of IoT systems include real-time processing, security, network reliability, as well as dealing with constrained hardware. 

Many of these requirements can only be addressed at *low-level* in close interface with the hardware architectures. C++ is a robust language, well suited for IoT development for its efficiency, control, especially in networking and communication between devices. It enables the development of protocols, data handling, and real-time interactions in connected and constrained systems. 

In this worksheet you will set up the workspace you need to start developing IoT systems with C++.
