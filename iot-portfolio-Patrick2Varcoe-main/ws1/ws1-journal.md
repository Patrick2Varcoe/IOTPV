# UFCFVK-15-2 Internet of Things - Worksheet 1 Journal

TODO: Add at least three entries on **three different dates** while working on your worksheet and detailing your progress:

Each entry should include:

* What you worked on that day (e.g., understanding HAL, creating sensor, display , etc)
* What issues did you face and how did you solve them? (e.g., debugging, researching, asking tutors for help, etc) Add links to any resources you found useful and as much detail as possible. Explore different approaches.
* What did you learn from the issues/solutions?
* After the second entry, reflect on how your approach to problem-solving has evolved and what you would do differently next time.

After creating one entry, commit and push your changes to your repository. **You should commit your journal entries no later than a week written.**
